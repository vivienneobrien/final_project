Week 7
-	Took a step back this week:
-	Began to break data down into more clear graphs to make it more user friendly.
-	Inputs of data: 
o	2 countries i.e. USA + UK
o	Choose your base currency i.e. 
		The currency you are interested in buying for example USD.

-	A plot graph of what I am currently trying to do:
1.	Plotting global accumulative death rates every day and where the forex price was that day.
2.	Plotting the American death rates every day and how much the USD was worth compare to the GBP pound that day
3.	Plotting the United Kingdom death rates everyday and how much the USD was worth compare to the GBP.
-	Worked on more efficient ways to import my data compare to uploading a csv file e.g. using the quandl API and manipulating data this way.
-	Difficulty: Was able to use a sample of the COVID-19 data set API however this is only a daily recording. 
-	Did more work with csv in the mean time
-	Need to fix normalisation method as my results are too large a value from what is predicted
